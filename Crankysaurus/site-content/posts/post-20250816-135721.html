<p>Dear Santa,<br>I know I'm 53, but Rexie says age discrimination is illegal and you have to take my requests seriously or he'll chomp you.<br>This year I have been:<br>☐ Good ☐ Bad ☑ Successfully supervised by dinosaurs<br>My Christmas wishes:</p>
<p>Demon writing supervisor plushie (Pete has been pre-warned)<br>More stickers (holographic preferred, Rexie demands quality)<br>For everyone to discover ROAR goals and stop being mean to themselves<br>A world where Christmas starts in September and no one complains<br>Steam games on sale (actually, this happens anyway, but thanks)</p>
<p>In exchange, I promise to:</p>
<p>Share TCC wisdom with the world<br>Only threaten to punch woodland creatures before 8 AM<br>Continue achieving remarkable things while being completely ridiculous</p>
<p>P.S. Mrs. Claus probably needs to hear about my tracking system. Workshop productivity would improve 80% with proper dinosaur supervision.<br>Love and prehistoric roars,<br>The Crankysaurus</p>
