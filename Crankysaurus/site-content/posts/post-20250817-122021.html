<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Goals. It's such a short word, but completing and tracking them can be a huge endeavour. I tried and failed for years until I created a system that works for me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Do any of these situations sound familiar?</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Excitedly writing a list of New Years Resolutions in December, only for them to have fallen by the wayside by February.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Brainstorming a huge list of goals, realising that you've bitten off more than you can chew, get overwhelmed and ending up achieving nothing.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Setting ambitious weekly targets that collapse the moment life happens.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Feeling guilty every time you see your abandoned goal tracker.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Starting fresh with a new system every few months because &lsquo;this time will be different&rsquo;.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Failing, then waiting for a specific time like Mercury coming out of retrograde (or Monday, or the 1st of the month, or your birthday) before starting again.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Buying expensive planners/apps thinking the right system will fix everything.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Setting goals that sound impressive but make you miserable to work on.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Comparing your progress to productivity gurus on social media and feeling inadequate.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Abandoning goals completely after one &lsquo;bad&rsquo; day instead of just getting back on track.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Believing that you are the problem, that you just don't have what it takes to get things done.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">If you can relate to any of these, you're not alone &ndash; studies suggest that over 80% of New Year's resolutions are abandoned by February. I was one of the 80% casualties for years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Things started to change for me towards the end of 2024. It had been a rough year, and when I did my annual personal audit after Christmas, I was really disappointed by how little I&rsquo;d achieved. That got me thinking about all the Decembers I&rsquo;d felt the same way, so for 2025, I gave myself one new goal:<br><br><strong>Find a tracking system that works for me.</strong><br><br>I gave myself other goals, too, and I&rsquo;ll talk about those in another post, but my primary purpose for 2025 was to work out a system that I could stick with. I decided that if was the only thing I achieved that year, I would be delighted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">I&rsquo;m going to change the subject for a bit, as I think it&rsquo;s worth talking about the idea of an &lsquo;inner child&rsquo;. This isn&rsquo;t to be taken literally; rather, it's a concept describing the part of the psyche that carries the emotions, beliefs, and experiences from their childhood. The inner child can have both positive and negative aspects, and can affect how an adult interacts with the world and the choices they make.<em> </em>I realised that many of the negative reactions I had to my goal-setting plans were those that could be associated with the inner child: the frustration when things went badly; the days when I looked at my enormous list and just said, "No!"; giving up on the whole thing &ndash; basically throwing my toys out of the cot.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">This got me thinking about ways that parents encourage children to modify their behaviour, which eventually led me to remembering an episode of the show <em>Supernanny</em>. Presenter Jo Frost successfully uses sticker charts to reward little kids for doing the things their parents wanted them to do, and I figured if it works for actual five-year-olds, maybe it could work for my Inner Five-Year-Old to soothe her goal-setting tantrums.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">And that&rsquo;s how <em>The Crankysaurus Chronicles</em> was born.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Take a look at the next post to learn about dinosaur mentors and ROAR goals.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Before I go, I want to acknowledge that traditional productivity methods do work brilliantly for thousands of people. If you'd like to explore some tried-and-tested alternatives to dinosaur supervision, you can find a list of other goal-tracking and productivity systems <a href="https://crankysauruschronicles.com/?post=post-20250817-120020" target="_parent">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Until next time,&nbsp;</span></p>
